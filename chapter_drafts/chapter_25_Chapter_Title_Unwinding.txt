connection with the merchants, focusing on their shared responsibility towards their city. The youngest zongdu,

as bastions of stability and cooperation borne out of the tumultuous Platinum Affair.
However, Yangchen perceives a gap between the merchants'
proclaimed prosperity and the reality of suffering in Bin-Er.
She makes a heartfelt appeal to the shangs, urging them to listen to the cries of their workers and elevate their standards
of living, rather than exploit their positions. Yangchen emphasizes that a true measure of prosperity includes the
well-being of all, not just a privileged few.

without acknowledging these workers. With the weight of their plight on your shoulders, you muster the
courage to speak up, asserting that true leadership means listening—requiring these merchants to consider
the humanity behind their transactions. You challenge them to redefine prosperity, compelling them to see that
it is not merely about wealth accumulation but the well-being of every individual in the community.

Key Point :Economic Disparity and Human
Responsibility
Critical Interpretation :In this chapter, the tension between Avatar Yangchen and the shang leaders of
Bin-Er illustrates profound economic disparity and the ethical responsibilities that come with leadership. While
Yangchen appeals for compassion and equitable treatment of the city's workers, the indifferent response
from the shangs underscores the often self-serving nature of power dynamics in governance and commerce.
This scenario prompts readers to question the effectiveness of leadership that fails to acknowledge the
broader societal implications of economic policies.
Yangchen's struggle emphasizes a critical perspective on the traditional views of prosperity, suggesting that true
success should encompass the welfare of all citizens, not just the affluent. Yet, readers are encouraged to consider
that the author's portrayal of Yangchen's resolve and the shangs' attitudes may be overly simplistic or idealized,
lacking nuance in the complexities of real-world economics and politics. Historical analyses on economic
inequality, such as Piketty's "Capital in the Twenty-First

Century," could provide a broader context for
Yangchen's struggle against such entrenched systems.

**Keeping Score**
In this gripping chapter, Avatar Yangchen finds herself in a challenging position during a meeting with the city's shangs,
who control trade and resources. As the Avatar, she’s expected to inspire and lead, yet she feels the weight of their
disdain and manipulation. Boma, her guardian, struggles to support her amidst this tension, highlighting their shared
vulnerability in a complex political landscape.
Initially, Yangchen attempts to offer advice and guidance,
hoping to bridge the gap between her and the shangs. But her words fall on deaf ears, and she realizes they view her as a
laughing stock rather than a leader. Noehi's sarcastic comments and the dismissive attitudes of the shangs
compound her frustration, as they prioritize profits over the welfare of the people. Despite her best efforts, they refuse to
see the value in investing in their community.
As the conversation devolves, Yangchen’s patience snaps.
She boldly accuses the shangs of financial improprieties that risk the Earth King’s interests, revealing her secret
surveillance of the city. This revelation catches everyone off guard and signifies her determination to take a stand rather
than cower. Her pointed remarks about hidden cargo and

forcing the shangs to confront the implications of their actions.
By the end of the chapter, the atmosphere shifts dramatically as Yangchen asserts her authority, suggesting that any illicit
gains could be redirected to help the people—before her next meeting with the Earth King. The power dynamics in the
room evolve, and for the first time, the shangs are left speechless. Henshe, the peacekeeper, recognizes the brewing
conflict and the daunting task ahead, hinting at the challenges
Yangchen will continue to face.
This chapter explores themes of power, authority, and the struggle for integrity in a world dominated by greed.

down, emphasizing her growth and the passionate leadership she brings to the table despite overwhelming odds.
