Though the girl was back in\n\nthe infirmary being watched by the elders, her cries of pain sprang from\n\nevery surface, bouncing off the hard stone.",
      "visual_prompt": "Wide shot of an ancient temple hallway, high ceilings with intricate carvings, dimly lit with flickering torchlight casting long shadows. The atmosphere is tense with an echoing soundscape, as if screams are reverberating off the stone walls. The camera slowly tracks along the hallway, capturing the sense of urgency and foreboding.",

Ignoring\n\ndecorum, she sped past her sisters, ruffling robes, upsetting inkpots,\n\nprematurely ruining colorful sand paintings that were meant to be ruined\n\nonly once they were finished. No one scolded her or gave her sharp looks in\n\npassing. They understood.",
      "visual_prompt": "Dynamic shot of Jetsun running through a corridor, her robes billowing behind her, sand paintings scattering in a flurry of colors.

The upside-down construction\n\nof the temple meant that despite its overall size, there was very little space\n\nto stand on, nothing connecting the spires but thin air and a three-thousandfoot drop. She didn\u2019t have her glider. Eminently dangerous, but she could\n\nmake the leap without it.\n\nAir at her back and air against her robes gave her enough loft to land on\n\nthe next tower, the one containing the Great Library.",
